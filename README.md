<h2>About me</h2>

Hi, Iâ€™m Ankit Kumar Singh, a Backend-focused Full Stack Developer with 2+ years of experience. I build scalable, container-based systems using Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and work with Kafka and Flink for stream processing. Passionate about developing secure APIs and efficient data pipelines, especially in high-impact domains like ad tech and cloud platforms.
âš¡ I believe in solving core problems with clean architecture and continuous learning.
ðŸ’¬ Always happy to connect or collaborate on backend innovation.

  <tr>
    <td><a target="_blank" href="#">Sandeep Kishore</a></td>
    <td>Ankit impressed me with his ability to containerize and deploy complex backend solutions using Docker and Kubernetes. His understanding of microservices, authentication layers, and distributed cloud systems is sharp and practical â€” he builds with purpose and scale in mind.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a target="_blank" href="#">Manish Kumar</a></td>
    <td>While working on backend-heavy ad analytics modules, Ankit was the one who handled all major deployment challenges. He introduced Kafka stream processing to our stack and helped reduce processing latency by over 30%. His decision-making under pressure is admirable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a target="_blank" href="#">Aman Kumar</a></td>
    <td>What I value most about Ankit is his willingness to take risks on backend architecture decisions â€” and they usually pay off. From building robust APIs to deploying real-time monitoring tools, heâ€™s a team player who also leads from the front when systems get complicated.</td>
